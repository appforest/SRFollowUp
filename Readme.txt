*****************
Service Request Follow Up allows you to store service requests (Srx) to a database and keep track of them, you can add customer information (Name, email), Srx status and notes about it.

Installation:

- There is a install.php file that creates a database file (SQLite3 is used), a table inside of it with columns for: Name, Last Name, Email, Service request number, Status and description. However a premade database is located inside the project files (you can edit the database by using the Adminer.php file included [Adminer's website: http://www.adminer.org/]).

So far you can:

- Add Srx's to the database and they will be show on a list.
- You can search Srx's by number/code.

What is not implemented yet:

- I cannot figure out how to relate the printed Srx number to its own value so an Ajax request can be made in order to add the Srx to the edit form.

To do:

- Different search methods (by name, last name or email).
- Add a 'Creation time' column.
- Add a delete button (with a confirmation dialog).
