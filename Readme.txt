*****************
Service Request Follow Up allows you to store service requests (Srx) to a database and keep track of them, you can add customer information (Name, email), Srx status and notes about it.

Installation:

- There is a install.php file that creates a database file (SQLite3 is used), a table inside of it with columns for: Name, Last Name, Email, Service request number, Status and description. However a premade database is located inside the project files (you can edit the database by using the Adminer.php file included [Adminer's website: http://www.adminer.org/]).

So far you can:

- Add Srx's to the database and they will be show on a list.
- You can search Srx's by number/code.
- Edit Srx's.
- Delete Srx's.
